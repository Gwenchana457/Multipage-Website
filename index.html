    <div class="my-element"><p style="text-align: center;">It’s a tale as old as time: the struggle to choose a path in a world of endless possibilities. My journey has been a chaotic, sometimes comical, exploration of fleeting interests and grand ambitions. From dreaming of becoming a crime-fighting hero to briefly embracing the life of a master hacker, I've dabbled in it all—each new hobby a brief, passionate obsession that burned brightly before I moved on to the next.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">I'm a connoisseur of "trial and trial," with an ever-growing list of pursuits I've started but not finished. Yet, through all the detours and dead ends, one constant remained: my deep-seated curiosity. It was this restless spirit that led me to the perfect field for my unique brand of indecision: Information Technology.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">It wasn't a lifelong passion that drew me in, but the practicality of a field that is constantly evolving, demanding continuous learning, and offering a new challenge at every turn. In the end, I didn't find my path in a single, predictable passion, but in a career that embraced my need for endless new stories.</p>
